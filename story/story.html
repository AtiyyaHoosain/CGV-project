            <p>Ages before you were born your grandfather was a zealous archeologist.</p>
            <p> He hasnâ€™t been able to travel after contracting a nasty disease and has showed you some maps pointing to a treasure that he has always wished to find. </p>
            <p>To honor him you decide to embark on a journey to find it. You have to travel through the wild Amazon jungle, the frosty Artic and a desolate pyramid.</p>
            <p>Race through the mazes to find the treasure before the clock runs out!</p>
